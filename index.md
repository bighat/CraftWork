Welcome to David Hatton's Web presence. Go to my <a href="/portfolio/index.html">Portfolio</a> to see examples of my work.
 </p> 
 <p>I have been living in Colchester for the last 26 years. After leaving Art School, I joined the Art Department of a Colchester based Leisure Design company where I worked for five years before turning to freelance work.
Being self employed for the last twenty years has allowed me to work in a wide range of disciplines. This has varied from large scale art work to small scale technical model-making and prototyping, and from mural painting to wood and stone carving.
